# IoT Data Pipeline: Real-Time Environmental Monitoring

## 📜 Description
This project integrates IoT devices and software tools to create a real-time data pipeline. It reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor using NodeMCU, sends the data to a PostgreSQL database, and automates the workflow with Apache Airflow.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time data collection from DHT11 via NodeMCU.
- Data storage in PostgreSQL.
- Automated data insertion every 25 seconds using Airflow.
- Scalable and modular architecture.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.8 or later.
2. Install PostgreSQL.
3. Install Arduino IDE.
4. Install Airflow and required Python libraries:
